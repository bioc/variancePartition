\title{Colinearity score}
\usage{
colinearityScore(fit)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{regression model fit from lm() or lmer()}
}
\value{
Returns the colinearity score between 0 and 1, where a score > 0.999 means the degree of colinearity is too high.  This function reports the correlation matrix between coefficient estimates for fixed effects.  The colinearity score is the maximum absolute correlation value of this matrix. Note that the values are the correlation between the parameter estimates, and not between the variables themselves.
}
\description{
Colinearity score for a regression model indicating if variables are too highly correlated to give meaningful results
}
\examples{

# load library
# library(variancePartition)

# load simulated data:
data(varPartData)
form <- ~ Age + (1|Individual) + (1|Tissue) 

res <- fitVarPartModel( geneExpr[1:10,], form, info )
 
# evaluate the colinearity score on the first model fit
# this reports the correlation matrix between coefficients estimates
# for fixed effects
# the colinearity score is the maximum absolute correlation value
# If the colinearity score > .999 then the variance parition 
# estimates may be problematic
# In that case, a least one variable should be omitted
colinearityScore(res[[1]])
