\title{Extract variance statistics}
\usage{
extractVarPart(modelList, adjust = NULL, adjustAll = FALSE,
  showWarnings = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelList}{list of lmer() model fits}

\item{adjust}{remove variation from specified variables from the denominator.  This computes the adjusted ICC with respect to the specified variables}

\item{adjustAll}{adjust for all variables.  This computes the adjusted ICC with respect to all variables. This overrides the previous argument, so all variables are include in adjust.}

\item{showWarnings}{show warnings about model fit (default TRUE)}

\item{...}{other arguments}
}
\value{
data.frame of fraction of variance explained by each variable, after correcting for all others.
}
\description{
Extract variance statistics from list of models fit with lm() or lmer()
}
\examples{
# library(variancePartition)

# optional step to run analysis in parallel on multicore machines
# Here, we used 4 threads
library(doParallel)
cl <- makeCluster(4)
registerDoParallel(cl)
# or by using the doSNOW package

# load simulated data:
# geneExpr: matrix of gene expression values
# info: information/metadata about each sample
data(varPartData)

# Specify variables to consider
# Age is continuous so we model it as a fixed effect
# Individual and Tissue are both categorical, so we model them as random effects
form <- ~ Age + (1|Individual) + (1|Tissue) 

# Step 1: fit linear mixed model on gene expresson
# If categoritical variables are specified, a linear mixed model is used
# If all variables are modeled as continuous, a linear model is used
# each entry in results is a regression model fit on a single gene
# Step 2: extract variance fractions from each model fit
# for each gene, returns fraction of variation attributable to each variable 
# Interpretation: the variance explained by each variable
# after correction for all other variables
varPart <- fitExtractVarPartModel( geneExpr, form, info )
 
# violin plot of contribution of each variable to total variance
plotVarPart( sortCols( varPart ) )

# Advanced: 
# Fit model and extract variance in two separate steps
# Step 1: fit model for each gene, store model fit for each gene in a list
results <- fitVarPartModel( geneExpr, form, info )

# Step 2: extract variance fractions
varPart <- extractVarPart( results )

# stop cluster
stopCluster(cl)
